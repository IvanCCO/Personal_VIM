# Personal Vim

This repository is intended to store the Vim configurations I use, ensuring that all my environments have a consistent setup.

By using Vim, I can take advantage of its powerful motions and customize keymaps to streamline my coding experience. This approach allows me to maintain a consistent environment across different IDEs, enhancing my productivity and efficiency.

The reason I choose to use Vim in these setups is because Vim motions open up possibilities for me to customize my keymaps exactly the way I want, making the IDE adapt to me rather than the other way around.

### VSCode

In Visual Studio Code, I essentially use the same configurations as in IntelliJ. However, it is necessary to set up two files to ensure proper functionality: one for remapping predefined shortcuts and another for configuring the Vim plugin itself.
